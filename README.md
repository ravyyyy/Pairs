# Pairs
A C# project made for college which simulates the Memory Tiles game. <br/>
You can create/delete users (using XML), log in with them and play the game: Standard (6x6) or Custom (NxM)(must be even number of tiles). <br/>
Also has a Statistics page, where you can see your own score or all the scores of the users. <br/>
